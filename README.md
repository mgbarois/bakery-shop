## Running the project

### Setting up local server

This project uses ES6 modules for better component reusability. This means you can not open the `index.html` in the browser file via its `file://` URL, due to browser security restrictions (Chrome blocks ES module imports when opening files directly from the filesystem without a server).

So, in order to view the page correctly, you will need to run a local server. Here are some quick options:

#### Option 1: Python Simple HTTP Server

If you have Python3 installed, run:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

#### Option 2: VS Code Live Server Extension

Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Right-click index.html â†’ Click "Open with Live Server".

Your file will open at http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html.

#### Option 3: Node.js with http-server

If you have Node.js installed:

Install a simple HTTP server:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Navigate to your project folder and run:

```
http-server .
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
